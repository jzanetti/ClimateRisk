Welcome to ClimateRisk
#######

**ClimateRisk** is an open-source repository that conducts climate risk (e.g., tropical cyclone, flood, earthquake, landslide etc.)
and adaptation analysis, focusing on the New Zealand transportation sector (e.g., State highway, local roads, railway, supply chain, road fatalities etc.).

The base model used in **ClimateRisk** is `CLIMADA <https://wcr.ethz.ch/research/climada.html>`_.
Additional New Zealand specifications have been added with a range of options for visualization. The codes for **ClimateRisk** can be accessed `here <https://github.com/jzanetti/ClimateRisk>`_.
